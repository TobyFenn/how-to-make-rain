# Operation Popeye

Operation Popeye was a covert weather modification program conducted by the United States during the Vietnam War.

### Key Details

- **Time Period**: 1967-1972
- **Location**: Vietnam and Laos
- **Objective**: Increase rainfall to disrupt enemy supply lines

### Methodology

- Cloud seeding using silver iodide and lead iodide
- Aircraft dispersed chemicals into clouds over the Ho Chi Minh Trail

### Claimed Effects

- Extended monsoon season by 30-45 days
- Increased rainfall by up to 30% in targeted areas

### Controversy and Aftermath

1. **Ethical Concerns**: 
   - Use of environmental modification as a weapon
   - Potential long-term ecological impacts

2. **Political Fallout**:
   - Public outcry when revealed in 1971
   - Led to the Environmental Modification Convention (ENMOD) in 1976

3. **Legal Implications**:
   - ENMOD prohibited use of environmental modification techniques in warfare

### Legacy

- Raised awareness about potential military applications of weather modification
- Contributed to ongoing debates about geoengineering and climate control

### Scientific Uncertainty

- Actual effectiveness of the operation remains disputed
- Difficulty in distinguishing seeding effects from natural variability
