# Seeding 

## 1. Seeding Process

### 1.1 Aggregation

Aggregation is the process by which ice particles collide and stick together to form larger particles:

-  Ice crystals or snowflakes collide in the cloud
-  They adhere to each other, forming larger aggregates
-  This process is particularly important in the formation of snowflakes
-  Aggregation efficiency depends on factors like:
  - Temperature
  - Crystal shape
  - Relative humidity

### 1.2 Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN)

> CCN are tiny particles that serve as the foundation for cloud droplet formation.

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Size | Typically 0.2 m in diameter |
| Relative Size | One hundredth the size of a typical cloud droplet |
| Function | Provide surfaces for water vapor condensation |

#### Types of CCN:

1. Sea salt particles from ocean spray
2. Sulfate particles from volcanic activity or oxidation of sulfur dioxide
3. Organic particles from oxidation of volatile organic compounds
4. Soot/black carbon from combustion (e.g., forest fires, engines)
5. Dust particles
6. Clay particles
7. Sodium chloride (NaCl)
8. Ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4)

**Key Points:**
- CCN concentrations range from about 100-1000 per cm in the atmosphere
- Hygroscopic particles like sulfates and sea salt make better CCN than hydrophobic particles like some dust or soot

### 1.3 Ice Nucleating Particles (INP)

Types of INP include:

-  Mineral dust (e.g., clay minerals like kaolinite)
-  Biological particles (e.g., bacteria, pollen, fungal spores)
-  Soot/black carbon
-  Volcanic ash
-  Some organic particles

**Important characteristics:**
- IN are generally larger particles than CCN
- IN are much less abundant than CCN, typically less than 1 per liter of air
- IN are active at higher temperatures than homogeneous ice nucleation

### 1.4 Particle Sizes and Distribution

The effectiveness of particles as CCN or IN depends on:
1. Size
2. Chemical composition
3. Surface properties

#### Optimal Particle Size for Hygroscopic Seeding

| Size Range | Reason for Optimality |
|------------|------------------------|
| 1-10 microns | Ideal balance of size and suspension ability |
| 2-5 microns | Considered optimal for some experiments |

**Why this size range is optimal:**
-  Large enough to serve as effective CCN
-  Small enough to remain suspended in the cloud
-  Promotes rapid growth through collision-coalescence

### 1.5 Over-seeding and Competition Effect

> Over-seeding can lead to unintended consequences in cloud formation and precipitation.

**Consequences of introducing too many hygroscopic particles:**
1. Increased competition for available water vapor
2. Narrower droplet spectrum with many small droplets rather than fewer large ones

***Example:*** A study by Cooper et al. (1997) found that seeding with numerous 1 m particles produced high concentrations of drizzle drops rather than fewer larger raindrops.

**The Competition Effect:**
- Too many CCN or ice nuclei result in numerous small droplets/crystals
- Small particles may not grow large enough to fall as precipitation
- Available moisture is spread too thinly among too many particles

## 2. Types of Seeding

### 2.1 Glaciogenic Seeding

 **Target:** Cold clouds (below freezing) or mixed-phase clouds

 **Typical Locations:** Mid-latitude or mountainous regions

 **Environment:** Most effective in continental environments

#### Process:
1. Ice nucleating particles are introduced into supercooled liquid water
2. Particles initiate ice crystal formation
3. Promotes ice particle growth through vapor deposition and riming

#### Materials:
- Silver iodide (AgI) - most common
- Dry ice (solid CO2)
- Liquid propane

> AgI is typically dispersed via acetone burners or pyrotechnic flares

#### Objectives:
- Increases ice crystal concentration in clouds lacking natural ice nuclei
- Can potentially increase snowfall in winter orographic clouds
- May accelerate precipitation in convective clouds

#### Scientific Backing:
-  Strong evidence of microphysical effects (increased ice crystals)
-  Some statistical evidence of precipitation increases in winter orographic clouds
-  Recent field campaigns (e.g., SNOWIE) provided detailed observations

### 2.2 Hygroscopic Seeding

 **Target:** Warm clouds (above freezing) or mixed-phase clouds

 **Typical Locations:** Tropical or subtropical regions

 **Environment:** Can be effective in continental or maritime environments

#### Process:
1. Large hygroscopic particles (e.g., salt powders, flares) are injected into cloud base
2. Particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to form large cloud droplets
3. Promotes collision-coalescence process to form raindrops

#### Materials:
- Salt powders (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2)
- Hygroscopic flares containing salts and burning agents
- Optimal particle size: 2-5 microns

#### Objectives:
- Accelerates warm rain process
- Can potentially increase rainfall in shallow/warm clouds
- May counteract effects of pollution on precipitation

#### Scientific Backing:
-  Laboratory and modeling studies show enhanced droplet growth
-  Some randomized field experiments showed increased rainfall (e.g., South Africa)
-  Physical basis is well-established, but large-scale effects still uncertain

### 2.3 Dual-mode Seeding (Combination of Both)

- Combines aspects of both glaciogenic and hygroscopic seeding
- Aims to target both warm and cold cloud processes
- May be used in mixed-phase clouds or in regions with varied cloud types

## 3. Seeding Agents

### 3.1 Silver Iodide (AgI)

> The most common seeding agent for cold-cloud seeding

**Chemical Properties:**
- Formula: AgI
- Appearance: Bright yellow solid (often appears greyish due to silver impurities)
- Molecular weight: 234.77 g/mol
- Composition: 45.95% silver, 54.05% iodine

**Preparation:**
1. Mix a solution of silver ions (e.g., from silver nitrate) with a solution containing iodide ions (e.g., from potassium iodide)
2. Silver iodide precipitates as a yellowish solid
3. The reaction can be represented as: 
   
   `AgNO + KI  AgI + KNO`

### 3.2 Potassium Iodide (KI)

- Often used in combination with AgI
- Enhances the effectiveness of AgI in some seeding operations

### 3.3 Hygroscopic Salts

Used for warm-cloud seeding:

| Salt | Chemical Formula |
|------|------------------|
| Sodium Chloride | NaCl |
| Calcium Chloride | CaCl2 |
| Potassium Chloride | KCl |

> These salts are highly effective at attracting and holding water molecules

### 3.4 Biodegradable Alternatives

Emerging alternatives to traditional seeding agents:

-  Pseudomonas syringae (bacteria)
-  Certain organic compounds

> Aim to reduce environmental impact of cloud seeding operations
