## 1. Introduction and Background

### 1.1 Project Overview

- **Duration**: 2005-2014
- **Funding**: Wyoming Water Development Commission (WWDC)
- **Primary Goal**: Determine the viability of cloud seeding for augmenting water supplies in Wyoming

### 1.2 Target Areas

The WWMPP established cloud-seeding research programs in three Wyoming mountain ranges:

1. Medicine Bow Range
2. Sierra Madre Range
3. Wind River Range

### 1.3 Orographic Cloud Seeding Concept

> Orographic cloud seeding is designed to enhance precipitation in winter storms with inefficient precipitation processes due to a lack of natural ice nuclei.

Key points:
- Uses ground-based generators to produce silver iodide plumes
- Plumes are transported by ambient winds into orographic clouds
- Aims to increase precipitation by creating additional ice crystals

### 1.4 Project Structure

- **Operations**: Weather Modification, Inc. (WMI)
- **Evaluation**: National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR)
- **Additional Contributors**: 
  - University of Wyoming
  - Desert Research Institute
  - Heritage Environmental Consultants
  - University of Alabama
  - University of Nevada Las Vegas
  - University of Tennessee

### 1.5 Oversight and Collaboration

- Technical Advisory Team (TAT) established
- Local stakeholders engaged throughout the project

## 3. Physical, Statistical, and Modeling Analyses

### 3.1 Physical Studies

#### 3.1.1 Trace Chemical Analysis

- **Purpose**: Determine silver incorporation from cloud seeding
- **Finding**: Variable results, but generally lower than Australian studies

#### 3.1.2 Ground-based Measurements

- **Instrument**: Acoustic ice nucleus counter (AINC)
- **Duration**: First three project years (2008-2011)
- **Key Finding**: Confirmed silver iodide reaching intended target

#### 3.1.3 Aircraft Studies

- **Conducted by**: University of Wyoming
- **Initial Results**: Up to 25% increase in precipitation for 7 lightly precipitating storms
- **Follow-up Studies**: Less pronounced effects, highlighting need for larger sample sizes

### 3.2 Modeling Studies

- **Model Used**: Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) with NCAR cloud-seeding module
- **Seasons Simulated**: 2009-2010, 2011-2012, 2013-2014
- **Key Results**: 
  - Simulated seeding effects between 10-15% in both mountain ranges
  - Model performance verified using radiometer, snow gauge, and sounding data

### 3.3 Statistical Studies

#### 3.3.1 Primary Analysis

- **Total RSE Cases**: 154
- **Cases Included in Analysis**: 118
- **Primary Result**: 
  - RRR = 1.03
  - p-value = 0.28
  - Interpretation: 3% increase in precipitation, 28% chance of occurring by chance

#### 3.3.2 Secondary Analyses

1. **Unintended Downwind Effects**:
   - 18 cases with downwind impacts identified
   - Removing these cases increased RRR to 1.09

2. **Silver Iodide Reaching Target**:
   - 21 cases with confirmed silver iodide at target
   - Removing these cases increased RRR from 1.03 to 1.04

3. **Generator Hours Stratification**:
   - RRR increased to 1.17 for cases with ≥27 generator hours
   - Suggests sufficient seeding agent necessary for detectable effect

> **Note**: These secondary analyses, while informative, cannot claim statistical significance due to post-hoc nature.
