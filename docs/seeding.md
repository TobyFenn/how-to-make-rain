# Seeding

## Seeding Process

### Aggregation
Aggregation is the process by which ice particles collide and stick together to form larger particles:
- Ice crystals or snowflakes collide in the cloud
- They adhere to each other, forming larger aggregates
- This process is particularly important in the formation of snowflakes
- Aggregation efficiency depends on factors like temperature, crystal shape, and relative humidity

### Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN)
- Small particles, typically 0.2 µm in diameter, that serve as surfaces for water vapor condensation, leading to cloud formation
- One hundredth the size of a typical cloud droplet
- Water requires a non-gaseous surface for the transition from vapor to liquid, a process facilitated by CCNs
- Types of CCN:
  - Sea salt particles from ocean spray
  - Sulfate particles from volcanic activity or oxidation of sulfur dioxide
  - Organic particles from oxidation of volatile organic compounds
  - Soot/black carbon from combustion (e.g. forest fires, engines)
  - Dust particles
  - Clay particles
  - Sodium chloride (NaCl)
  - Ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4)
- CCN concentrations range from about 100-1000 per cm3 in the atmosphere
- Hygroscopic particles like sulfates and sea salt make better CCN than hydrophobic particles like some dust or soot

### Ice Nucleating Particles (INP)
- Types of INP:
  - Mineral dust (e.g. clay minerals like kaolinite)
  - Biological particles (e.g. bacteria, pollen, fungal spores)
  - Soot/black carbon
  - Volcanic ash
  - Some organic particles
- IN are generally larger particles than CCN
- IN are much less abundant than CCN, typically less than 1 per liter of air
- IN are active at higher temperatures than homogeneous ice nucleation

### Particle Sizes and Distribution
- The ability of particles to act as CCN or IN depends on their size, chemical composition, and surface properties
- Optimal particle size for hygroscopic seeding is typically in the range of 1-10 microns, with 2-5 microns considered optimal for some experiments
- This size is optimal because:
  - Particles are large enough to serve as effective CCN
  - They're small enough to remain suspended in the cloud
  - This size range promotes rapid growth through collision-coalescence

### Over-seeding and Competition Effect
- If too many hygroscopic particles are introduced, it can lead to increased competition for available water vapor
- This can result in a narrower droplet spectrum with many small droplets rather than fewer large ones
- For example, a study by Cooper et al. (1997) found that seeding with numerous 1 μm particles produced high concentrations of drizzle drops rather than fewer larger raindrops
- The optimal balance is to introduce enough particles to enhance coalescence without over-seeding and suppressing drop growth
- Too many CCN or ice nuclei can result in numerous small droplets/crystals
- These small particles may not grow large enough to fall as precipitation
- This can lead to a "competition effect" where available moisture is spread too thinly among too many particles

## Types of Seeding

### Glaciogenic Seeding
- Used in cold clouds (below freezing) or mixed-phase clouds
- Typically used in mid-latitude or mountainous regions
- Most effective in continental environments
- Process:
  - Ice nucleating particles are introduced into supercooled liquid water
  - Particles initiate ice crystal formation
  - Promotes ice particle growth through vapor deposition and riming
- Materials:
  - Silver iodide (AgI) - most common
  - Dry ice (solid CO2)
  - Liquid propane
- AgI is typically dispersed via acetone burners or pyrotechnic flares
- Why:
  - Increases ice crystal concentration in clouds lacking natural ice nuclei
  - Can potentially increase snowfall in winter orographic clouds
  - May accelerate precipitation in convective clouds
- Science backing:
  - Strong evidence of microphysical effects (increased ice crystals)
  - Some statistical evidence of precipitation increases in winter orographic clouds
  - Recent field campaigns (e.g. SNOWIE) provided detailed observations

### Hygroscopic Seeding
- Used in warm clouds (above freezing) or mixed-phase clouds
- Typically used in tropical or subtropical regions
- Can be effective in continental or maritime environments
- Process:
  - Large hygroscopic particles (e.g. salt powders, flares) are injected into cloud base
  - Particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to form large cloud droplets
  - Promotes collision-coalescence process to form raindrops
- Materials:
  - Salt powders (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2)
  - Hygroscopic flares containing salts and burning agents
  - Optimal particle size is 2-5 microns
- Why:
  - Accelerates warm rain process
  - Can potentially increase rainfall in shallow/warm clouds
  - May counteract effects of pollution on precipitation
- Science backing:
  - Laboratory and modeling studies show enhanced droplet growth
  - Some randomized field experiments showed increased rainfall (e.g. South Africa)
  - Physical basis is well-established, but large-scale effects still uncertain

### Dual-mode Seeding (Combination of Both)
- Combines aspects of both glaciogenic and hygroscopic seeding
- Aims to target both warm and cold cloud processes
- May be used in mixed-phase clouds or in regions with varied cloud types

## Seeding Agents

### Silver Iodide (AgI)
- Most common seeding agent for cold-cloud seeding
- Highly effective ice nucleating particle
- Chemical formula: AgI
- Bright yellow solid (though often appears greyish due to silver impurities)
- Molecular weight: 234.77 g/mol
- Composition: 45.95% silver, 54.05% iodine
- Preparation:
  - A solution of silver ions (e.g., from silver nitrate) is mixed with a solution containing iodide ions (e.g., from potassium iodide)
  - Silver iodide precipitates as a yellowish solid
  - The reaction can be represented as: AgNO₃ + KI → AgI + KNO₃

### Potassium Iodide (KI)
- Often used in combination with AgI
- Enhances the effectiveness of AgI in some seeding operations

### Hygroscopic Salts
- Used for warm-cloud seeding
- Examples:
  - Sodium Chloride (NaCl)
  - Calcium Chloride (CaCl2)
  - Potassium Chloride (KCl)
- These salts are highly effective at attracting and holding water molecules

### Biodegradable Alternatives
- Emerging alternatives to traditional seeding agents
- Examples:
  - Pseudomonas syringae (bacteria)
  - Certain organic compounds
- Aim to reduce environmental impact of cloud seeding operations

## Dispersion Techniques

### Atomizers and Aerosol Devices
- Used to disperse liquid or solid particles into the air for cloud seeding
- Types:
  - Pressure atomization: Liquid forced through a small orifice at high pressure
  - Air-blast atomization: High-velocity air stream breaks up liquid
  - Rotary atomization: Liquid dispersed by centrifugal force from a spinning disk
  - Ultrasonic atomization: High-frequency vibrations break up liquid
  - Electrospray: Electrical forces disperse charged liquid droplets

### Ground Generators
- Stationary devices placed on the ground, typically in mountainous regions
- Most common method for dispersing seeding agents in winter orographic cloud seeding operations
- Key features:
