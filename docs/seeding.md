## SEEDING

- **Seeding Process**
  - Aggregation
  - Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN)
  - Ice Nucleating Particles (INP)
  - Particle sizes and distribution
  - Over-seeding and competition effect

- **Types of Seeding**
  - Glaciogenic seeding
  - Hygroscopic seeding
  - Dual-mode seeding (combination of both)

- **Seeding Agents**
  - Silver Iodide (AgI)
  - Potassium Iodide (KI)
  - Hygroscopic salts (e.g., NaCl, CaCl2)
  - Biodegradable alternatives

- **Dispersion Techniques**
  - Atomizers and aerosol devices
  - Ground generators
  - Aircraft-based methods
    - Burn-in-place flares
    - Ejectable flares
    - Liquid spray systems
  - Rocket-based seeding
  - UAV (Drone) seeding
