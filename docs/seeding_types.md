# Types of Seeding

## Glaciogenic Seeding

'Glaciogenic agents are mostly ice nuclei, although some glaciogenic agents are effectively hhydrophilic nuclei' (ASCE).

 **Target:** Cold clouds (below freezing) or mixed-phase clouds

 **Typical Locations:** Mid-latitude or mountainous regions

 **Environment:** Most effective in continental environments

### Process:
1. Ice nucleating particles are introduced into supercooled liquid water
2. Particles initiate ice crystal formation
3. Promotes ice particle growth through vapor deposition and riming

### Materials:
- Silver iodide (AgI) - most common
- Dry ice (solid CO2)
- Liquid propane

> AgI is typically dispersed via acetone burners or pyrotechnic flares.

#### Objectives:
- Increase ice crystal concentration in clouds lacking natural ice nuclei
- Increase snowfall in winter orographic clouds
- Accelerate precipitation in convective clouds

#### Scientific Backing:
-  Strong evidence of microphysical effects (increased ice crystals)
-  Some statistical evidence of precipitation increases in winter orographic clouds
-  Recent field campaigns (e.g., SNOWIE) provided detailed observations

## Hygroscopic Seeding

Hygroscopic agents deliquesce (dissolve into their aqueous components), becoming a solution droplet by absorbing water vapor from the air (at relative humidities significantly less than 100%).

 **Target:** Warm clouds (above freezing) or mixed-phase clouds

 **Typical Locations:** Tropical or subtropical regions

 **Environment:** Can be effective in continental or maritime environments

### Process:
1. Large hygroscopic particles (e.g., salt powders, flares) are injected into cloud base
2. Particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to form large cloud droplets
3. Promotes collision-coalescence process to form raindrops

### Materials:
- Salt powders (NaCl, KCl, CaCl2)
- Hygroscopic flares containing salts and burning agents
- Optimal particle size: 2-5 microns

#### Objectives:
- Accelerates warm rain process
- Can potentially increase rainfall in shallow/warm clouds
- May counteract effects of pollution on precipitation

#### Scientific Backing:
-  Laboratory and modeling studies show enhanced droplet growth
-  Some randomized field experiments showed increased rainfall (e.g., South Africa)
-  Physical basis is well-established, but large-scale effects still uncertain

## Dual-mode Seeding (Combination of Both)

- Combines aspects of both glaciogenic and hygroscopic seeding
- Aims to target both warm and cold cloud processes
- May be used in mixed-phase clouds or in regions with varied cloud types
