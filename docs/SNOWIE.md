# SNOWIE (Seeded and Natural Orographic Wintertime Clouds: The Idaho Experiment)

## Introduction

SNOWIE marked a turning point in cloud seeding technology. Conducted from 2017 to 2021 in Idaho's Payette Mountains, this experiment introduced groundbreaking innovations that addressed longstanding challenges in the field.

### Background

- Climate change and population growth have increased water demand in arid regions
- Cloud seeding has been evaluated as a potential technology to increase water supply
- Previous studies relied on statistical comparisons, often with inconclusive results

For decades, cloud seeding suffered from "the attribution problem." Despite 70 years of practice, the industry struggled to definitively prove its effectiveness. This lack of clear evidence led to skepticism and diminished commercial interest.

## Innovations

### 1. High-Resolution Mobile Radar

SNOWIE developed portable, high-resolution radar systems that could be deployed directly in seeding areas, offering unprecedented detail in cloud analysis. These radars allowed researchers to:

- Measure precise cloud conditions before and after seeding
- Detect clear signatures of water-to-ice phase changes
- Attribute rainfall to seeding efforts with remarkable accuracy

### 2. Perpendicular Flight Path

SNOWIE aircraft flew perpendicular to the crosswind direction, creating a distinctive "zebra pattern" of precipitation. This uniform spacing made it far easier to distinguish seeded rainfall from natural precipitation.

### 3. Novel Approach to Isolate Seeding-Induced Precipitation

- Identified areas with light or no natural precipitation (<1 mm/h)
- Used radar observations to track spatial and temporal evolution
- Quantified snowfall accumulation using radar data and snow gauge measurements
- Developed relationships between radar reflectivity (Ze) and liquid equivalent snowfall rate (S)

## Methods

### Data Collection

- **Precipitation Gauges**: Network deployed in the study area
- **Radars**: Two ground-based Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radars
- **Airborne Observations**: Radar and seeding operations

> All data are publicly available through the SNOWIE data archive website and the SNOWIE radar data archive.

## Results and Discussion

SNOWIE's advancements enabled researchers to measure seeding-induced rainfall with extraordinary precision - within an accuracy of 100,000 gallons. In some cases, a single day's operation produced 100-121 acre-feet of water, equivalent to hundreds of millions of gallons.

## Impact on the Industry

SNOWIE's success was a catalyst. Rainmaker now aims to replicate and build upon these measurement techniques, bringing cloud seeding into the realm of data-driven, scientifically-validated technology.

By solving the attribution problem, SNOWIE has potentially opened the door for a renaissance in weather modification.

## Historical Context

Prior to SNOWIE, cloud seeding relied on less precise methods:
- Planes dispersing agents with limited control
- Ground-based "bonfires" spewing chemicals skyward
- Rudimentary rain gauges for measurement

These methods often resulted in immeasurable or statistically insignificant increases in precipitation, making it difficult to justify the cost and effort involved.

## Future Work

1. Quantifying ice and snow production in seeded clouds
2. Studying environmental conditions and cloud dynamic/microphysical processes
