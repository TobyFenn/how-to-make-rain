# SNOWIE Project: Quantifying Snowfall from Orographic Cloud Seeding

## Introduction

The Seeded and Natural Orographic Wintertime Clouds: The Idaho Experiment (SNOWIE) project aimed to quantify snowfall generated by cloud seeding in mountain cloud systems. This study introduced a physically-based approach to unambiguously isolate and quantify precipitation generated by cloud seeding.

### Background

- Climate change and population growth have increased water demand in arid regions
- Cloud seeding has been evaluated as a potential technology to increase water supply
- Previous studies relied on statistical comparisons, often with inconclusive results

### Study Focus

The study focused on three cloud seeding events in January 2017 in the Payette basin of Idaho, using:

1. A network of precipitation gauges
2. Two ground-based radars
3. Airborne cloud seeding with silver iodide (AgI)

## Methods

### Novel Approach

The researchers employed a unique method to isolate seeding-induced precipitation:

1. Identified areas with light or no natural precipitation (<1 mm/h)
2. Used radar observations to track spatial and temporal evolution
3. Quantified snowfall accumulation using radar data and snow gauge measurements
4. Developed relationships between radar reflectivity (Ze) and liquid equivalent snowfall rate (S)

### Data Collection

- **Precipitation Gauges**: Network deployed in the study area
- **Radars**: Two ground-based Doppler on Wheels (DOW) radars
- **Airborne Observations**: Radar and seeding operations

> All data are publicly available through the SNOWIE data archive website and the SNOWIE radar data archive.

## Key Findings and Significance

### Quantitative Evidence

1. **Snow Accumulations**: 
   - Range: 0.05 to 0.28 mm at gauge sites
2. **Precipitation Rates**: 
   - Range: 0.4 to 1.2 mm/h
3. **Total Liquid Equivalent Snowfall**:

### Factors Influencing Seeding Efficacy

- Wind conditions
- Terrain
- Atmospheric variables

### Uncertainty in Estimates

- Range: 20% to 47% due to variability in Ze-S relationships

### Significance
